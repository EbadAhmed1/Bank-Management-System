# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++)

This is a console-based **Bank Management System** developed in **C++**. The application allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking balances, and deleting accounts — all through a menu-driven interface.

## ✅ Features

- ➕ Create new bank account  
- 💰 Deposit amount to an account  
- 💸 Withdraw amount from an account  
- 📊 Check account balance  
- 📝 Display all account holders  
- ❌ Delete an account  
- 🔄 Modify account details  
- 📁 Data stored persistently using file handling

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

The program utilizes:
- **Classes and OOP principles** to model bank accounts
- **File I/O** (`fstream`) to store and retrieve account data
- A **menu-based interface** for user interaction
- Validation and input handling for a better user experience

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- File Handling (Binary mode)  
- Console-based User Interface

---

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.cpp` – Main program file with complete banking logic  
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)  
- `account.dat` – Data file generated during runtime to store all account records

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Applying **object-oriented concepts** in real-world scenarios  
- Working with **binary file handling** using `fstream`  
- Designing an **interactive, persistent system** in C++  
- Structuring code with **modularity and clarity**
